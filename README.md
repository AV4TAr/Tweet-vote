Tweet vote
==========

The intention of this is to learn how mongodb works, and do some frontend realtime updates (using node.js and some queueing).
The purpose of this project is to vote tweets. Those tweets are fetched from the twitter stream filtered by some keywords.

So, its a quick and dirty (very kiss) app to monitor a twitter stream, store it in mongoDB and then showing it live.
